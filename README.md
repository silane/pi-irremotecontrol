# pi-irremotecontrol
Infrared remote controller program for Raspberry Pi


## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi
- Infrared LED
- Infrared receiver (I tested with TSOP1738)


## Build
1. Install [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/)
1. Clone and make

      ```Shell
      git clone https://github.com/silane/pi-irremotecontrol.git
      cd pi-irremotecontrol
      make
      ```
      
## Usage
### ir-record
This program is used to record the infrared signal from remote controller.

1. Build a circuit with infrared receiver and Raspberry Pi.
   This instruction assumes the signal pin of the infrared receiver is connected to PIN 1.
   Note that signal must be LOW when it is receiving infrared light and
   HIGH when it is not receiving the light.
1. Run `./ir-record -f signal.csv 1`.
1. Just after running the program, press the button that you want to record on the remote controller, aiming receiver.
1. Infrared signal data is recorded in `signal.csv`

### ir-send
This program is used to send the infrared signal recorded by `ir-record`.

1. Build a circuit with infrared LED and Raspberry Pi.
   LED must be connected to pin that supports PWM.
   This instruction assumes the LED is connected to PIN 1.
1. Aim LED at the device that you want to control.
1. Run `./ir-send -f signal.csv 1`, where `signal.csv` is the infrared signal data file generated by `ir-record`.
